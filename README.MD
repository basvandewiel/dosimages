# DOS Container manifests

This repository contains build manifests for use with DOS Container. These manifests
combine a disk image, operating system, the game itself and bootup scripts into a
single file that can be used with (primarily) the MiSTer AO486 core, but any other
half-decent MS-DOS emulator should work just as well.

This repository does not contain any copyrighted works from third parties and is not
supposed to do so. These manifests are purely the recipes for doscontainer to work
from. You still need to provide the raw ingredients.

## Work in progress

This repository represents a work in progress. Nothing of what you find here is ready
for prime time in any way as long as DOS Container itself is still in major flux.

While this work is out in the open, you are entirely on your own if you choose to
download it for any purpose.
